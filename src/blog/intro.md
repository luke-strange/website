## Hello

I am a data scientist / engineer / web developer at [Open Innovations](https://open-innovations.org). My role could best be described as "building stuff with data". You can read some of my [blogs](https://open-innovations.org/blog/) to find out more about what I do.

Python is my programming language of choice, but I also use R and SQL. For web stuff, I use JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML and CSS. I didn't know anything about the web, or building websites, until I started working at Open Innovations. But I like making things - web development reminds me a bit of Lego, which I was obsessed with as a kid.

I have also found that I like writing about the work I do. Having a record of things online feels a bit easier to maintain and looks more exciting than a CV (although I do have one of those too).

I hope I will post some interesting stuff here in the future. Let's see.
